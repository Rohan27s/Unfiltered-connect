      "INNOVISION the Photography and Film Society of Maharaja Surajmal Institute. Innovision consists of two words- “INNO” means to innovate and “VISION” means the way to see something. They tend to give us visions through their photographs. It has been a key society and has played a major role since its inception, covering all the major and minor events in both MSI and MSIT. Innovision was started 3 years ago by a bunch of professional photographers who dedicated their soul and heart into photography. Their core team comprises 2 presidents each  from MSIT and MSI respectively. Under them they have 2 heads each from MSI and MSIT respectively. Right now, approximately there are 28 students who are part of this society. Society is all about learning and growing together. They help develop a vision that people might miss out on. They conduct various events and seminars throughout the year. The major outdoor activity that they do is ‘PHOTOWALK’, a session in which the students travel and explore different parts of the city under the guidance of the heads and seniors and try to capture stories and visuals. Photowalks are great, they help in getting to know each other better, building professional as well as personal bonds and enabling everyone to grow together in this field.",
