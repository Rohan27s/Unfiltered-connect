      "The National Service Scheme (NSS) is a Central Sector Scheme of Government of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports. It provides opportunity to the students of schools, colleges and university level to take part in various government led community service activities & programmes. The sole aim of the NSS is to provide hands-on experience to young students in delivering community service. NSS Cell, MSI Janakpuri is an official student regulated body that operates with the unified aim, “Not me, but you”. Headed by Head Girl Nandini Agarwal and Head Boy Kartikey Bhatia, our vision is to build the youth with the mind and spirit to serve society and work for the social upliftment of the down-trodden masses of our nation as a movement. Social workers’ efforts have the capacity to transform lives at the individual level while also creating a ripple effect at the community-level, to continue a wave of inspiration and motivation for generations. In social care, we work with some of society’s most vulnerable people- underprivileged children, elders in old age homes, animals that lack proper care, women lacking resources and education, just to name a few. We believe that the core values of social work, including compassionate service to others, fostering dignity for all individuals, social justice, and promoting stronger human relationships are vital for overall growth and self-development of a student and hence instill these principles within our volunteers. Over the span of 2 years, NSS has introduced various Projects to focus on multiple initiatives, like: Project Avani , Project Indriya, Project Kara-Kriya , Project Nirog, Project Sanrakshan , Project Sanskriti, Project Seva , Project Veerangana , Project Vriddhi , and Project Yuva. NSS Volunteers can choose to join any department as per their skills and interests, these are: Events department, Marketing and PR department, Sponsorship department, Content department, Graphic Design and Video Editing department, Social Media department, Youtube and Podcast department, Tech department, Creativity department, and Research and Development department. With 10 active projects, an efficient administrative council of 6, a well-populated executive core team of 40+ members, 400+ volunteers, NSS has achieved great accomplishments in the last year.",

      "INNOVISION the Photography and Film Society of Maharaja Surajmal Institute. Innovision consists of two words- “INNO” means to innovate and “VISION” means the way to see something. They tend to give us visions through their photographs. It has been a key society and has played a major role since its inception, covering all the major and minor events in both MSI and MSIT. Innovision was started 3 years ago by a bunch of professional photographers who dedicated their soul and heart into photography. Their core team comprises 2 presidents each  from MSIT and MSI respectively. Under them they have 2 heads each from MSI and MSIT respectively. Right now, approximately there are 28 students who are part of this society. Society is all about learning and growing together. They help develop a vision that people might miss out on. They conduct various events and seminars throughout the year. The major outdoor activity that they do is ‘PHOTOWALK’, a session in which the students travel and explore different parts of the city under the guidance of the heads and seniors and try to capture stories and visuals. Photowalks are great, they help in getting to know each other better, building professional as well as personal bonds and enabling everyone to grow together in this field.",
