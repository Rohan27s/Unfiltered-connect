            "Blackout, an Inter College Coding Contest sponsored and organized by Computer Society of India, Student Branch, Maharaja Surajmal Institute on 28th November 2022 in Lab 1 and 4, First Floor, Maharaja Surajmal Institute from 10 A.M to 2:15 P.M. The event started with the welcome of Faculty organizers and participants. This competition aimed at bringing out the coders from their comfort zone coding to a whole new level. This was not like some other coding competitions; it came up with a twist. The twist involved was that the coders cannot see their monitors, i.e., they cannot see what they type. This event had two rounds:      ⦁	Knock – Out Round    ⦁	Final Round          In the first round a total of 25 minutes was given to the participants with a set of 3 questions and in the final round a total of 30 minutes with a set of 2 questions was given to all the finalists. The level of questions was fairly increased in the final round to uplift the level of competition. A team of volunteers was present in the Lab all the time to ensure a smooth and fair competition.             This competition saw a participation of 113 enthusiastic coders from Maharaja and Surajmal Institute and other colleges like Jagannath Institute of Management Studies (JIMS), Delhi School of Entrepreneurship (DSEU), etc. Out of these 113 participants, only 30 students were given a chance to compete in the final round.           All the sets of questions were designed to challenge the student coders, promote out of the box thinking and to judge their analytical skills. During the competition the spirit of the coders was unmatched and remarkable.           The event involved certificates and three amazing cash prizes worth ₹2,200/-. The first prize for ₹1,000/- was bagged by Sheersh Jaiswal (BCA, IInd Year, MSI). The second prize for ₹700/- was awarded to Sheersh Jaiswal (BCA, IInd Year, JIMS, Rohini). The third prize for ₹500/- was bagged by Pranshu Mittal (BCA, Ist Year, MSI). All the participants who reached the final round of this event were sent E-Certificates for their participation.The intense hard work and efforts of all the Student Coordinators and Volunteers under the able guidance of Ms. Rhythm Choudhary (Convener, Delhi State Student Coordinator, CSI), Mr. Manoj Kumar (Convener), and Mr. Harjender Singh (Coordinator) made this event successful and truly remarkable.
